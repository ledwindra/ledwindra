# Henlo there 👋🏽

If coding is not for fun, then what is it for? For money? Sure, because not having it can totally be not fun.

- 🖥 I’m currently working in tech and doing an econ RA
- 📊 I was as a Research Associate at [<strong>an institution</strong>](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/) where the co-founders won [<strong>Nobel Prize in Economics in 2019</strong>](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2019/press-release/),
- ♥ Topics that I'm interested in:
  - 👩🏽‍💻 Diversity in tech and would be glad if I could engage in the activity to support this cause. 🌈
  - 📢 Development economics and research for data-driven public policy.
- 🗣 I speak:
  - Indonesian (native)
  - English (second language)
  - [<strong>Python</strong>](https://www.python.org/) (but I'm afraid of 🐍 the animal)
  - [<strong>R</strong>](https://cran.r-project.org/) (sometimes, it's the first general purpose programming language that brought me joy to write code)
  - [<strong>Stata</strong>](https://www.stata.com/) (my first programming language, check out my [repo](https://github.com/ledwindra/continuous-integration-stata) on automating Stata workflow!),
- 🌞 In my native language :indonesia:, pronouns are simple and gender neutral: [<strong>"dia"</strong>](https://www.kbbi.web.id/dia) and [<strong>"nya"</strong>](https://www.kbbi.web.id/-ni%20nya). For English speakers, I'm comfortable with he/him (because singular they doesn't seem to be commonly used).
- 📚 Reading for pleasure is something I that I like to do besides writing programs. Visit my [<strong>Goodreads</strong>](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31603929-lukman-edwindra) page.
- 🎼 2020 was tough. I wanted to build a journaling habit of my daily lessons (or abbreviated as `#TIL`. You can [<strong>check it out</strong>](https://github.com/ledwindra/today-i-learned) but I didn't manage to do it continuously. 😃
