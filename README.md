### Hi there 👋

If coding is not for fun, then what is it for? For money? Sure, because not having it can totally be not fun. I support diversity in tech. 🎗🏳️‍🌈👩🏽‍🔬

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Data Engineer at a financial technology company,
- 🔭 I was as a Research Associate at an institution where the co-founders won Nobel Prize in Economics in 2019,
- 🌱 I speak Indonesian, English, Python, R, and Stata,
- 📫 You can reach me on email: lukman.edwindra@gmail.com,
- 😄 In my native language :indonesia:, it's simple to use a pronoun: "dia" (yes, it's gender neutral!),
